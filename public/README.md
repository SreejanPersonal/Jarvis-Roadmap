# Public Directory - Static Assets

The `public` directory in the Checkpoint Navigator project is dedicated to storing static assets. These assets are files that are served directly to the browser without any processing by Vite or other build tools. This directory is typically used for items like favicons, images, and other resources that do not require any transformation or bundling.

## Contents

### `favicon.ico`

- **Purpose:** This is the favicon for the Checkpoint Navigator website. A favicon is a small icon that is displayed in the browser tab or window next to the page title.
- **Usage:** Browsers automatically request `favicon.ico` from the root of your site (or in the `public` directory in development) and display it. It helps in visually identifying your website among multiple open tabs and in browser bookmarks.
- **Customization:** To customize the favicon, you can replace this `favicon.ico` file with your own icon file. Ensure that the file is in the `.ico` format for broad browser compatibility. You can generate favicon files from images using online favicon generators.

### `og-image.png`

- **Purpose:** This image is used as the default Open Graph image for the Checkpoint Navigator website. Open Graph images are used when your website is shared on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. They provide a visual preview of the link.
- **Usage:** When a link to your Checkpoint Navigator application is shared on social media, this `og-image.png` will be displayed as the preview image. This helps in making your shared links more visually appealing and informative.
- **Customization:** To customize the social media preview image, replace this `og-image.png` file with your own image. It's recommended to use an image that is representative of your application. Common dimensions for Open Graph images are 1200x630 pixels, but it's good to check the specific recommendations of the social media platforms you are targeting.

### `placeholder.svg`

- **Purpose:** This file provides a placeholder SVG image. It might be used within the application as a default image or as a temporary visual element during development.
- **Usage:** While its specific usage within Checkpoint Navigator would depend on the components that reference it, placeholder images are generally used to occupy space in the layout before actual content is loaded or available. SVGs are used because they are scalable and maintain visual clarity at any size.
- **Customization:** If you need to change the placeholder image, you can either modify this `placeholder.svg` file directly (by editing the SVG code) or replace it with a different SVG or image file. If replacing, ensure that the new file is named `placeholder.svg` if you want to maintain consistency without updating any code that might be referencing this specific filename.

## Adding New Static Assets

You can add more static assets to the `public` directory as needed. Any files placed in this directory will be accessible in your application at the root URL, e.g., a file named `image.png` in the `public` directory would be accessible at `/image.png`.

**Example:** If you add a file named `logo.png` to the `public` directory, you can reference it in your React components like this:

```typescript jsx
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

## Important Considerations

- **Directly Served:** Files in the `public` directory are served directly without being processed by Vite. This means they are not bundled, minified, or transformed in any way.
- **URL Path:** The path to access files in the `public` directory in your application starts from the root (`/`).
- ** যখন ব্যবহার করবেন:** Use the `public` directory for assets that are truly static and do not need to be processed by the build tool. For most images and assets used in React components, especially those that are imported and managed as modules, it's often better to place them in the `src` directory and import them directly in your components. The `public` directory is best suited for files like favicons, robots.txt, and manifest files.

By understanding the purpose and contents of the `public` directory, you can effectively manage static assets in your Checkpoint Navigator project.
